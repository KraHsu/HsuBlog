## Quick Start

### Installation

For this part, you can directly refer to the [README](https://github.com/KraHsu/HsuBlog/tree/main#readme).

Here are the simplified steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KraHsu/HsuBlog.git ./myblog

cd ./myblog

yarn install

yarn run dev
# or
npm install

npm run dev
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the website running locally.

### Upgrading

In theory, the steps below should work just fine. But, whether you've tweaked the theme or just used it normally, always remember to back up your changes. Better safe than sorry!

```bash
git pull
```
